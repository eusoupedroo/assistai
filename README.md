# ASSISTAI - WEBSITE THAT SHOWS THE STREAMING AVAILABLE IN YOUR SEARCH MOVIE

### About This Project:
Have you ever remembered a movie you really wanted to watch but had no idea which streaming platform it was available on? Or realized that your favorite movie was removed from Netflix and wondered where it could be found now? Many people face this situation and wonder if there is a website or app that can help them find which streaming platform a particular movie is available on.

Well, this happened to me recently, and thinking about it, I created 'AssistAI' in just one day. It's a site where you can search for a specific movie, and it returns not only the title, synopsis, and cast information but also the streaming platform where it can be found.

### Technologies Used In This Project And Yours Functions:

| Technologies | Function |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| HMTL & CSS | These languages was used to make the front-end of the project |
| JavaScript & Jquery | Used to make the ajax calls, this is important to add one more click in the url if the user click on the website, this way, i can make one ranking of the most populars websites|

### Observations Of This Project:
This is a 100% front-end project consuming an external API. It is worth remembering that this project is in its initial demonstration version and I am gradually adding improvements. Soon, for example, we will have the ability to search for series as well and add more information such as trailer videos, release date and much more.

### About 'The Movie Database' API:

The Movie Database (TMDb) API is a popular and comprehensive database for movies, TV shows, and celebrities. It offers a wide range of features and access to extensive information about films and TV shows. Here are some key points about the TMDb API:

<ul>
  <li>Titles, overviews, and detailed descriptions.</li>
